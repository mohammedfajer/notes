# Week 2 - Mouse Input and Spawning Game Objects


:::info

Task Sheet 2 - Working with UE5

:::

## Introduction

THis week we are going to extend the simple object we created in Task sheet 1, so that a mouse can be used with input, and projectiles can be fired.

Do the following:

1. Open the **Epic Games Launcher**, to load UE5 and click on the Launch button for **Version 5.2.1** (or select the down arrow to select the version required). The UE5 **project browser** should be displayed.

2. Open project **GDyn1**. (Alternatively, double-click on the **GDyn1.uproject** file, in the folder where you stored the project from the previous worksheet). The previous UE5 project should be opened with the default **GDMap** setup displayed.

3. It is good practice to refresh the **VS** files, on openning a UE5 C++ project. Do this through **Tools -> Refresh Visual Studio Project**.
