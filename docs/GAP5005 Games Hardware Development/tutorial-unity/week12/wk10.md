## Step 1 Importing Files and Creating a Scene

:::INFO
To speed up getting started today, I have configured a project for us to work with. In order to get a project to the point of the one you are about to download, you must follow Google’s instructions below. The reason we are not doing it today is because we have no admin rights to download files, and so I have done the very simple tutorial for us. However, if you do wish to do this in the future, follow this quick setup tutorial (3-4 minutes):

https://developers.google.com/cardboard/develop/unity/quickstart 


You will also need to make sure Android Build Support is installed via Unity Hub in your selected Unity version (the University PCs have this installed). 

:::

1. Download **‘VR Project’** from Moodle and open it up. Confirm downgrade/upgrade if prompted. This is a default Unity project, but I have followed the above tutorial for you due to previously mentioned reasons. 

2. Whilst on the Moodle page, download the **‘VR_Assets’** file. Import this into your scene. 

3. Create yourself a nicely laid out scene by dragging the **‘BlueBin’** and **‘GreenBin’** assets into the scene, create yourself a floor, and position your assets like so (make sure it’s the bins and not the crates!). Once the bins are in, drag the **‘BlueCrate’** and **‘GreenCrate’** objects into the scene and hide them under the floor (also tag the crates with a new tag of **‘Interactable’** – this is very important for later: 


 <div class="image-container">
<img src={IMG1} width={"70%"} alt="" />
</div>



4. Create yourself a new empty **GameObject** called **‘CameraRig’**. We’re going to house our camera in this object, so go ahead and make your camera a child of it. Position the **‘CameraRig’** object at position: 0, 2, 0, and make sure the main camera’s position is 0, 0, 0. Move the rig so it’s just in front of and above the bins. 


 <div class="image-container">
<img src={IMG2} width={"70%"} alt="" />
</div>

5. Part of the tutorial that I followed for you has you import a number of **‘ready-made assets’**. When using an engine like Unity, this is standard practice. I’m going to show you how to set your scene up now to be compatible with Google Cardboard.  

 Select your main camera and add the following component: 

**Tracked Pose Driver**

 <div class="image-container">
<img src={IMG3} width={"70%"} alt="" />
</div>

In older versions of Unity, far more setup was involved. For now, leave the above as is. 


6. Select your Main Camera and set the **‘near clip plane’** to 0.01. We do not want objects to be culled 
if they are too close, because that’s not how our eyes work. 

7. If you were to build to Android now, your VR scene would operate as expected using gyroscope and accelerometer to create a 3DoF experience. I would advise doing a test build at this point. Let me know if you need help with this.  


## Step 2 Creating a Basic Game/Mechanic (UI)

:::INFO

I appreciate more than most that we are venturing into virtual reality here, and so I have kept irrelevant mechanics to an absolute minimum. However, we do need to code a few things to actually make a playable demo, all of which will be handled in this step; Step 3 will focus completely on virtual reality. 

:::

1. Create a new folder called **‘Scripts’** and create a new C# class inside that called **‘Score’**. Open up the class. 

2. At the top, add the **‘using TMPro’** namespace, and declare yourself a new variable of type `TextMeshProUGUI` called **‘score’**. 

3. Go back to your scene, and on your **‘BlueBin’** object (in your scene, not in the Project panel), create a new text Mesh Pro object which is a child of the canvas (import any recommended packages). Set the font size to equal 1 and position the text in the centre of the canvas. You may need to scale the text object by selecting the Rect Transform tool (top-right) whilst holding control and selecting **‘stretch’**.

 <div class="image-container">
<img src={IMG4} width={"70%"} alt="" />
</div>


4. Make sure your bin looks like this, and then do the same for the greenbin (copy components): 

 <div class="image-container">
<img src={IMG5} width={"70%"} alt="" />
</div>


5. Create a new cube object which sits nicely in the bottom of the bin and set it to be a trigger – also remove the Mesh Renderer component; do this for both bins. Drag your **‘Score’** script onto each cube. 

6. Open up your class again and create an **`enum`** called **‘BinColour’** which holds two values named blue and green. Create a new variable of same type of your **`enum`**, and call it **‘binColour’**. If you can’t remember how to use enums ask me. Make sure to assign this via the Inspector Panel (blue or green) respectively.

7. Create a private float variable called **counter**. 

8. Set your score variable which we created earlier to equal the counter variable’s value. You will need to convert it to a string to do this. 

9. Create an `OnTriggerEnter(Collider other)` function, and implement an if statement which checks to see if our **`enum`** variable is equal to **BinColour.blue**.

10. Nest an if statement inside this which checks to see if the object which enters the trigger contains the name **‘Blue’**; if it does, add one to your counter variable. 

Create `an else` statement which deducts one from **counter**. 

11. Follow the exact same steps for the green bin. 

12. At the end of the **`OnTriggerEnter()`** function, delete the object which entered the trigger. 
 
Ensure all your variables are assigned, including your **enum**, in the inspector panel. 

## Step 3 Creating a Basic Game/Mechanic (Mechanic)

1. Go back to your scene and create a new empty `GameObject` called **‘BoxSpawner‘**. Create 3 empty `GameObjects` which are children of this object, and space them apart and below like so: 

 <div class="image-container">
<img src={IMG6} width={"70%"} alt="" />
</div>

Make sure they are positioned above and in the middle of your bins. Note they are just empty game objects. The icons are unity provided labels visible in editor only. If you want to add an icon to these empty `GameObjects` like I have, then you can assign them using the icon to the left of the name in the Inspector Panel that resembles a cube. 


2. Create a new script called **‘SpawnCrates’** and add it to your **‘BoxSpawner’** GameObject. Open up your class. 

3. Create two new `GameObject` arrays – one called **spawnPoints**, and one called **boxes**. 

4. Go to the Inspector Panel and set the length of **spawnPoints** to 3 – assign each of your spawn point objects to one of the indices. 

5. Set the length of boxes to 2 and drag the two **‘BlueCrate’** and **‘GreenCrate’** objects (found in the hierarchy panel) into your scene. 

6. Create a new method called **‘Spawn’**. 

7. Declare a new local int variable inside this method which stores a random value between 0 and **spawnPoints.Length**. 

8. Declare a new local 1GameObject` variable which selects and stores a random box from our boxes array.

9. Below these declarations, instantiate your random box at your random spawn point. 

10. Go to your start method and enter the following: 

```cs
InvokeRepeating("Spawn",  10,  4); 
```
What this does is calls our **‘Spawn()’** function after 10 seconds of the game starting, and then every 4 seconds thereafter – perfect for intermittently spawning boxes whilst giving us enough time to get the headset on to begin with! 


11. Add a **Rigidbody** component to the BlueCrate/GreenCrate in the hierarchy panel. This is not strictly needed (as long as one colliding object has an RB), but will add a bit of polish to our game when the boxes fall. 

:::INFO
Test your game, and we should have a very basic gameplay mechanic. Move your spawners so that boxes fall into your bins to check everything works, and then move on. 
:::


## Step 4 Implementing VR Mechanics


:::INFO
In this step, I am going to teach you a design technique which helps resolve the lack of input options that can sometimes hinder VR headsets. After completing this step, you will be able to pick up the crates which are spawning and will be able to place them in the bins for points. We will achieve this by using ‘gaze input’ which does what it says on the tin – input, by gazing (looking). I’ll be teaching you how to create robust methods which implement this technique. 

Please take your time on each step. There are three methods we need to create in a new class, so first: 
:::

1. Create a new C# class called **‘ObjPickup’** and add it to your main camera.

2. We are first of all going to concern ourselves with the first method, which is responsible for firing an invisible line from the camera, in a forward’s direction. This line will be used to detect if we are looking at an object, so we can pick it up. 
 
Create a new private variable of type `GameObject` named **obj**, and on of type <u>Rigidbody</u> named **_rb**. 
 
3. Create a new method called **CastRay** and call it in the **`Update()``** method. Inside your **CastRay** method, I am going to introduce you to raycasting (casting an invisible line to detect objects).

4. So, still inside the **CastRay** method, enter the following. Do not copy and paste as the below are not the same symbols your IDE uses! I have also labelled the lines to help you understand each of them; do not put this in your code. 
 
```cs
RaycastHit hit; 
Ray ray = new Ray(transform.position, transform.forward); 
if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit, 25)) 
{ 
} 
```

**Line 1**: This is a local variable of type <u>RaycastHit</u>. Anything our raycast hits, will be stored inside this variable, and we can subsequently access properties such as the **gameObject**, the transform, the collider, and so on.  

**Line 2**: We create another local variable, this time of type **Ray**. The Ray holds an origin and a direction, so in our case, because the script is attached to the main camera, the main camera will be our origin, and we will cast the ray forwards from the camera (the direction we look in). 

**Line 3**: A conditional statement where we pass in the two variables we just locally declared. What this line is saying is, if our **Ray** which we have just defined hits an object within 25 units of the forward direction, store that object in the variable hit. 

5. Nest an if statement inside your if statement which is casting the **Ray**. Your if statement should check for the following conditions: 

1. If the **`hit.collider.tag`** contains the characters **‘actable’**. 
2. If `obj` is equal to null 

6. The first condition I told you to check in the previous step will make no sense to you. What this check is doing is seeing if the object our raycast detects is tagged as something that contains the partial string **‘actable’**. Tag the two boxes (not the bins) as **‘Interactable’** in the editor. The reason we check for partial strings is because it nullifies errors caused by incorrect capitilisation, i.e. Interactable vs interactable.

7. Add some logic inside your if statement which achieves the following: 

1. Set the obj variable to equal **`hit.collider.gameObject`**. 
2. Set the **`_rb`** variable to rqual the `Rigidbody` attached to the obj variable. 

This is all the framework we need to start moving our object, so we can move on to our second method, and revisit this one later. 

8. Create a new method called **MoveObject** and call it in the `Update()` method.

9. Inside your new method, declare yourself a new local **Ray** variable called `ray` and set it to equal the same as we did in the other function.

10. Underneath this declaration, create an if statement and check if obj is NOT EQUAL TO null. What we are saying here is, if our raycast has detected an object, then we know we have something to move! 
 
Inside this if statement, we need to set the obj variable’s position. To do this, we’re going to need to use some of the API you haven’t seen before, so I’ll give you the code for two of the three lines we are going to put inside our if statement. So, inside the if statement you just created: 
 
```cs
_rb.constraints = RigidbodyConstraints.FreezeAll; 

Vector3 pos = (ray.origin + (ray.direction * 25); 
```

**Line 1**: When obj is not equal to null, we know that we want its movement to be influenced by where we look with our headset. While we move the object, we categorically DO NOT want the object to be rotating around, spinning, and banging off objects into the abyss, so we freeze the **Rigidbody** using the constraints options. 
 
**Line 2**: Creates a position that our obj variable will be placed when we move our heads around with the headset on. 

**Line 3** (your job): Set the position of obj to equal the new `Vector3` you constructed on <u>line 2</u>. 


11. The most important thing to do now is to run your game, and control your camera using the transform component while the game is active. Try and aim the camera at a box to pick it up. If you’ve done everything correctly, the box should be picked up, and should follow the camera around at a set distance when you **move/rotate** the camera. If so, good job, and continue.

12. You will notice that, even though we can pick the object up, we can never put it down, which is a bit useless. We need to come up with some logic that will allow us to drop the object, even though we have no buttons! 

So, the idea is: If the player doesn’t move their head for **x seconds**, drop the object. To do this, we need  to compare the position of the object on the previous frame, to its new position on the next frame. If those two positions are different, then we know our object is on the move still. If they are the same, we know our object is not moving, and if this continues for **x seconds**, we can drop the object. 

 The first step to achieve this is to create a new method with a return type of bool called **IsStatic()** and it should have a single parameter of type float called t (for time). DO NOT call this method from Update. 

13. Inside this method, create a new local **Vector3** variable called **`CurrPos`**. This is the variable which is used to store the obj position on the current frame. We will compare this to the previous frame in a moment. Before you proceed, declare a new global variable of type `Vector3` with the name **`lastKnownPos`**. This will hold the position of the object on the previous frame.

14. Create an if statement which checks the magnitude (size) of a vector like so: 

```cs
if((lastKnownPos-currPos).magnitude < 0.05f) 
```
 
What the above line is doing is taking away the current position (current from) from the position the object was on the previous frame (not implemented yet). If the difference/size is less than `0.05f` then we know the headset is relatively static. Do not check for zero unless you are developing for owls or some other bird of prey; humans cannot keep their head **PERFECTLY** still. 
 
Open the if statement with curly brackets. 


15. Create a new global variable of type float named **timer**. Inside the above if statement, add one to the timer variable each second. Then, directly below, check if **timer** is more than t. What this check does is check to see if the user’s head has been still for time you passed into the function. 


16. Inside that if statement, set timer to equal 0, and return true; We return true here because we know the user has kept their head still for x seconds, so our function returns true to satisfy this.

17. Now, we need to deal with the obj’s position on the previous frame. To do this, at the very end of your     `CheckIfStatic()` function, set the **`lastKnownPos`** variable to equal the obj’s position.


18. If we get this far down the function, we know the object is moving, so we can return **false**. 

19. Previously, I said to you, do not call this method inside update, and the reason for that is because we need to check if the function returns false inside the `MoveObject` method. Go to your `MoveObject` method, and create an if statement inside the if statement that is already in the method, we checks: 
```cs
if (!CheckIfStatic(3)) 
``` 
This condition will only ever be satisfied if the player does not move their head for three seconds (you can pass in whatever number you like).

20. Pass in the three lines of code (`_rb.constraints`… `Vector3 pos`… `obj.transform`…) into this if statement. Remove them from where they were previously.

21. Create an else statement after this if statement which sets the `_rb.constraints` to none, and `obj` to `null`.

22. Our code is almost in a fully workable state here, we just need to add a few more logical checks to the `CastRay` method, so that our object drops. 
Currently, because out object follows the position of the Ray, our camera is always going to be looking at it. This means that, even if we set `obj` to equal `null`, the same frame we drop it, we will pick up back up again. To fix this, we are going to stop the user from picking up the same cube if it was the last object they picked up. 
 
Create a new global variable of type `GameObject` called **lastObjectPicked**.


23. Inside the if statement which checks for the partial string (**‘actable’**), create a new if statement nested inside it, which checks to see if the hit.collider.`gameObject` IS EQUAL TO `lastObjectPicked`. If it is, simply return out of the method. The return keyword will stop the function on the line with return, and will ignore any code below. The reason we do this is because we know that the object we are looking at is the last one we picked up, so we have no interest in picking it up again, this exit the method.

24. Create an `else statement` after this if statement. Simply place the two lines **`(obj = hit… _rb = obj…)`** inside the else statement, and add another line after them which sets **`lastObjectPicked`** to equal <u>obj</u>. 

Test your game. If you’ve done everything correctly, you should be able to move your camera around to pick up cubes and drop them when you stay still for x seconds. If this works for you, build to android and try it with your headset.


## Step 5 Building

After testing your game and you're happy with the results:

1. Navigate to **`File > Build Settings > Android > Build`**. 
2. Save your `.APK` somewhere memorable and give it a suitable name.
3. Drag the file onto your device and install/test your application. You can email it to yourself if you prefer.


## Step 6 Analysing 

No work is involved in this step, but hopefully you can see how we can achieve some useful techniques without the use of buttons. Notice how natural picking objects up feels, even though you’re not using standard input methods. If you want to go further with your VR career, you can buy yourself a cheap Bluetooth controller, and you could implement some movement/additional mechanics. 

Take the time to analyse the methods learned today and adapt them where you feel necessary; if you see any small bugs, try and fix them up. Remember, this is one way of achieving a result which can be achieved in multiple ways.
